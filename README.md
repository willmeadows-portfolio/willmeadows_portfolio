# 👋 Hello! I'm Will Meadows

I’m a recent graduate from the University of Exeter with a First Class degree in Mathematics and Economics. Over the past few years, I’ve become really interested in how data can be used to make smarter decisions—whether that’s forecasting outcomes, spotting trends, or presenting insights in a way people can actually use.

This GitHub page is where I’m sharing some of the projects I’ve worked on, mostly focusing on data analysis, visualisation, and statistical modelling. I enjoy combining technical work with clear communication, and I’m always looking to learn more.

## 📊 Some projects I’ve worked on

### ⚽ Predicting Premier League Results  
As part of my final-year university project, I built a model in R to predict the outcomes of Premier League football matches using five seasons of match data. It involved a lot of data cleaning, regression modelling, and interpretation. I also created dashboards to show win probabilities and how performance changed over time.
